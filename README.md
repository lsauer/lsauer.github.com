### Building the site

The site uses the taskrunner Grunt to build the javascript resources, styles with maximum browser compatibility 
and finally bundle these files.

#### Grunt Tasks
  - **build**: creates the entire site build  (required prior to a git push/commit)
  - **default**: starts the watchers
       - Use the watcher task *css* to only monitor the styles folder
       - Use the watcher task *src* to only monitor code related folders
